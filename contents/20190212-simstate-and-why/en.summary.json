        "Simstate is a React state management library favoring React Hooks and TypeScript, designed to align with React's functional programming patterns. It addresses inconsistencies between class-based DI approaches (e.g., MobX) and React's functional style, offering cleaner integration via Hooks, HOCs, or render props. Inspired by unstated, it simplifies state handling with Context API-like logic but emphasizes Hooks for brevity. The library aims to enhance developer experience by reducing boilerplate and supporting future features like server-side rendering. Created as a personal solution and learning tool, it reflects the author's open-source journey, focusing on practical API design, testing, and community collaboration."
