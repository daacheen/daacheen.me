    "The article examines two pairs of software architecture quality attributes: security/safety and extensibility/scalability. Safety minimizes harm from unintentional accidents, while security protects against intentional attacks. Extensibility enables vertical system expansion (adding features), whereas scalability handles horizontal growth (increased workload). General and concrete scenarios illustrate each attributeâ€™s application, with safety focusing on redundancy and monitoring, and security emphasizing vulnerability testing and isolation. Extensibility strategies include modular design and refactoring, while scalability employs partitioning and caching. Tactics for each attribute balance benefits (e.g., robustness, flexibility) against penalties (cost, complexity), providing a framework for architectural decision-making."
