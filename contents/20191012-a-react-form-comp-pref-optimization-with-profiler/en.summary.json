    "A developer addressed severe performance issues in a React form, where input lagged significantly, especially when entering sequential keystrokes. Initially suspecting validations or form-wide re-renders, profiling with React DevTools revealed a Dropdown component (Semantic-UI) rendering 400+ options as the culprit. Each keystroke triggered re-renders, generating new option instances. The uncontrolled Dropdown was extracted into a PureComponent, memoizing options to prevent redundant renders. This reduced per-input render time from ~400ms to ~22ms, eliminating lag. The solution highlighted the importance of profiling to identify bottlenecks, controlled re-renders via memoization, and optimizing third-party components in large-scale React applications to maintain responsiveness."
