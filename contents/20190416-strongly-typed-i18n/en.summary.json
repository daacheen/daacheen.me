    "The document discusses the process of internationalization, also known as i18n, in product development. It explains how to deliver common content in different languages according to user preference. The document suggests using placeholders (IDs) in place of text content, which are replaced with localized strings during compilation or runtime. It also discusses different ways to define the mapping from ID to content, such as nested objects or plain key-value mapping. The document further discusses the benefits of using an ID, including automatic update when language changes, string interpolation, and fallback when current language doesn't define a value. However, it also highlights the issue of raw string IDs, which can be harmful without external support. The document concludes by suggesting the use of strongly typed IDs and the use of proxy objects."
