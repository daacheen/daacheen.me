    "The article discusses choosing dependency injection (DI) for small projects, comparing full DI frameworks (verbose) versus factory patterns (clumsy). The author developed a lightweight DI solution using Kotlin’s delegation and classgraph for scanning. Annotations (@Service, @ServiceImpl) mark interfaces and implementations, while a `di()` function delegates dependency resolution, enabling singleton injection with minimal code. Benefits include simplicity, circular dependency support, and dynamic resolution, though limitations include no `init` block usage and lack of advanced features. The author praises Kotlin’s modern features (null checks, lambdas) and how diverse programming paradigms expand problem-solving approaches, emphasizing tools’ influence on design thinking."
