## Development

[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) is required.

``` bash
# install dependencies
yarn

# Install dependencies From TaoBao
yarn iftb

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8000
yarn dev

# run production build
yarn build

# **After build**, serve the production build locally
yarn serve

# Update dependencies with npm-check-updates & install dependencies from Taobao
yarn upddep
```

## Firewall Notice

A dependency **sharp** needs to pull [prebuilt binaries from GitHub releases](https://github.com/lovell/sharp-libvips/releases) during installation. GitHub hosts release files on AWS, which is sometimes blocked in China. Failure to download these files will cause failure in installation and following steps.

Thankfully, according to [the official docs](http://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/en/stable/install/#pre-compiled-libvips-binaries), we can change the base url for this file. With the help of python 3's `http.server` module, we can start a local http server and serve the file from local.

If you encountered download error mentioned above, follow the following steps to complete installation:

1. Download the file yourself and place the file into a directory
2. Run `python -m http.server {port} --bind {url}` and keep it running until the installation completes.
3. Set the environment variable `SHARP_DIST_BASE_URL` to `http://{url}:{port}`
4. `npm install` and you are ready to go!


## Continuous Integration and Delivery
